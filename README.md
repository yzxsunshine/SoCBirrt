# SoCBirrt
Semi Online CBirrt. 
Build on CBirrt2 for Motion Planning couse
As time is really short for our final project, we have to directly modify the original CBirrt2. 
Code reconstruction will be done later.

Version 1.0: 
* create repository 

Version 1.1: 
* modify make file to create our "fork". 
* create file "SensorConfiguration" to simulate hand movement.(not finished)

Version 1.2:
* write basic structure for our algorithm.
* extract task region chain from initialization. We can keep modify TSR chain all the time
